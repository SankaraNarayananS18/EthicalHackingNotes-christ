1. Downloaded Required Files:
I downloaded the latest Kali Linux ISO from the official Kali website and installed VirtualBox on my system to begin virtualization.

2. Created a New Virtual Machine:
In VirtualBox, I created a new VM named "Kali Linux", selected the Linux type, and chose Debian (64-bit) as the version, which is compatible with Kali.

3. Configured System Resources:
I allocated 2 GB of RAM and assigned 2 CPU cores to ensure smooth performance during installation and usage.

4. Created Virtual Hard Disk:
I created a 20 GB virtual hard disk using the VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image) format with dynamically allocated storage to optimize space usage.

5. Attached the Kali ISO File:
Under Settings > Storage, I mounted the Kali Linux ISO image as an optical drive so that the VM could boot from it.

6. Started the Installation Process:
I launched the VM and selected "Graphical Install" to proceed with a user-friendly installation interface.

7. Selected Basic Configuration:
I chose my preferred language, location, and keyboard layout during the initial setup screens.

8. Set Host and User Details:
I provided a hostname, created a new user, and set a secure password for the system.

9. Partitioned the Virtual Disk:
I used the "Guided â€“ use entire disk" option to let the installer automatically configure partitions, which is the recommended method for most users.

10. Installed the GRUB Bootloader:
When prompted, I chose Yes to install the GRUB bootloader, allowing Kali Linux to boot properly after installation.

11. Completed Setup and Rebooted:
After the installation was complete, I removed the ISO from the virtual drive and rebooted the system. Kali Linux booted successfully, and I was able to log in and access the desktop environment.
